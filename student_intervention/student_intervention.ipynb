Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "SVM separates the students in 2 categories: those who pass and those who don't. Eventhough in reality those categories arent clearly separable because they are intricated (think about the Ying and Yang image: you cannot separate ying and yang), SVM has mathematical trick to draw a clear frontier. This frontier is drawn such as it maximizes its distance from the closest data points (instances in the training set). In a way, SVM looks mostly at the instances with opposite results that are the closest to each other, so it makes an extra effort separating samples that are more similar, hence its power.\n",

    "A decision tree is a simple sequence of decisions leading to a result. To make a prediction on a sample, it takes one feature at a time and compares its value to a threshold.

    "It is clearly better than the untuned model (DT was 0.73 and SVM 0.76). The decision tree implies that the # of failures contains all of the explanatory power of the data. Looking at the CSV, the relationship is clearly visible when putting the \"failures\" and \"passed\" columns side by side. The decision tree suggest that no other variable can provide additional information to improve the classification. Either the rest of the data has no correlation at all with the labels, or they are all strongly correlated to \"failures\". Which makes sense: the reasons why a student failed in the past are likely to be similar to the reasons why the student is about to fail (not pass) this year. "
